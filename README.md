# Assessing Cortical Region Contributions to EEG-Based Cognitive Workload Prediction

This repository contains all relevant codes and materials prepared for our work, _"Assessing Cortical Region Contributions to EEG-Based Cognitive Workload Prediction"_.

This paper presents a region-level evaluation framework for EEG-based workload prediction in which models are trained and evaluated using features derived from anatomically defined electrode groups. We perform a large-scale analysis across four publicly available EEG workload datasets spanning diverse task demands, recording hardware, and electrode montages. Region importance is quantified using a model-agnostic, performance-based approach under both mixed-subject and subject-independent evaluation protocols, with results aggregated using a rank-based strategy to ensure robustness across experimental configurations.

Across all datasets and subject-independent evaluations, frontal electrode groups outperform a full-scalp baseline by approximately 15–20\% in relative rank position while using substantially fewer electrodes. Fronto-central regions exhibit the most stable predictive contributions, whereas posterior and occipital regions contribute less consistently. These findings demonstrate that workload-relevant EEG information is spatially concentrated in frontal and fronto-central regions and support the design of efficient, generalizable EEG-based workload monitoring systems.
